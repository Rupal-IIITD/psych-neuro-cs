# How can I contribute?

>I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteers to help this project come to fruition.



## General Guidelines
###  Issues
- If you’re just getting started, work on an issue labeled “𝐠𝐨𝐨𝐝 𝐟𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐢𝐬𝐬𝐮𝐞”.
- If you’d like to create a new issue, please go through our issue list first (open as well as closed) and make sure the
  issues you are reporting do not replicate the existing issues.
  
### Pull Requests
- When sending a PR have an appropriate title referencing the issue which it solves. Add “fixes #” in the commit body, 
  so that when the PR gets merged, the issue gets closed automatically.
  
**Fork this repository and select any issue to contribute!**
